    <h1>About Decibels</h1>
    <p>
        I'm working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second
        page on our website, and it's the first page that we built ourselves!
    </p>
    <p>
        This site will update as we complete more of the tutorial, so keep
        checking back and see how our journey is going.
    </p>

    <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
        <li>
            I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.
        </li>
        {
            identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && (
                <li>
                    Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and{" "}
                    {identity.hobbies[1]}
                </li>
            )
        }
    </ul>
    <p>My skills are:</p>
    <ul>
        {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>
